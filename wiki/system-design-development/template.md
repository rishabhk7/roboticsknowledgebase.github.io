title: Mechanisms for Conversion of Rotary Motion
published: true

## Summary
This paper dives into the many mechanisms that exist to translate rotary motion from a motor to alternate forms of motions. Oftentimes, electromechanical systems require motion that cannot be directly provided with just a rotary motor. A variety of mechanisms exist to translate the torque and motion from a rotary motor to an alternate motion, such as linear motion, interrupted rotation, and rotary oscillation. This link serves as an extensive list for such mechanisms, and it serves useful to give users an idea of different ways they can utilize their actuators to perform specific motion. Not only does the paper give a description of how the mechanism works, but it also
